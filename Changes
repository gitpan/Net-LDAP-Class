Revision history for Net-LDAP-Class

0.01    10 July 2008
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    10 July 2008
        * fix Makefile.PL to include Net::LDAP::Batch dependency.

0.03    11 July 2008 
        * replace Scalar::Util::Clone with Clone (5.10 issue?)

0.04    21 July 2008
        * explicitly ask for meta->attributes whenever we search
        * add add_to_batch() and prev_batch() methods and refactor
          how rollback() works.
        * fix bug, renaming unique_keys to unique_attributes in a few
          leftover places.
        * add Active Directory classes for User and Group

0.05    22 July 2008
        * switch logic for AD User/Group to use Group->member as primary
          setting.
        * add a bunch of AD User attributes
        * get AD password set working
        * new object_or_meta_class() method type; switch attributes(),
          base_dn() and unique_attribues() in base Class to use it instead
          of defaulting to meta->$name. This means you can override any of 
          those values per-object, but they default to those set in the object
          class meta object.

0.06    23 July 2008
        * simplify encoding/decoding of AD password (no Encode required)

0.07    31 July 2008
        * refer everywhere internally in ::User::AD to ->gid instead
          of primaryGroupID() so that the attribute can be disabled in subclasses.
        * use ->attributes instead of ->meta->attributes everywhere internally
        * if fetch_* methods return undef from find() then return empty array(ref)
        * force random_string() to be a little more random
        * refactor ::User::AD objectSID code into its own functions

0.08    12 Aug 2008
        * check return result from Net::LDAP search() in find() and croak on error.
        * fix bug with action_for_delete() in ::Group::POSIX that manifested
          when trying to rename a group. New feature is 'skip_check' to skip
          the sanity check for whether a group still has users.
